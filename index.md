<div style="text-align: justify">To understand the process of life, it is crucial for us to study proteins and their functions. Proteins execute (almost) all cellular activities and their func- tions are standardized by Gene Ontology (GO). The amount of discovered pro- tein sequences grows rapidly as a consequence of the fast rate of development of technologies in gene sequencing. In UniProKB, there are more than 200 million proteins. Still, less than 1% of the proteins in the UniProtKB database are exper- imentally GO-annotated, which is the result of the exorbitant cost of biological experiments. To minimize the large gap, developing an efficient and effective method for automatic protein function prediction (AFP) is important.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">The release of Google's BERT is described as the beginning of a new era in NLP. In this notebook I'll use the HuggingFace's transformers library to fine-tune pretrained BERT model for a classification task. Then I will compare BERT's performance with a baseline model, in which I use a TF-IDF vectorizer and a Naive Bayes classifier. The transformers library helps us quickly and efficiently fine-tune the state-of-the-art BERT model and yield an accuracy rate 10% higher than the baseline model.</div>
