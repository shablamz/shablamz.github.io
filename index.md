<div style="text-align: justify">To understand the process of life, it is crucial for us to study proteins and their functions. Proteins execute (almost) all cellular activities and their func- tions are standardized by Gene Ontology (GO). The amount of discovered pro- tein sequences grows rapidly as a consequence of the fast rate of development of technologies in gene sequencing. In UniProKB, there are more than 200 million proteins. Still, less than 1% of the proteins in the UniProtKB database are exper- imentally GO-annotated, which is the result of the exorbitant cost of biological experiments. To minimize the large gap, developing an efficient and effective method for automatic protein function prediction (AFP) is important.</div>
