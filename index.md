<div style="text-align: justify">To understand the process of life, it is crucial for us to study proteins and their functions. Proteins execute (almost) all cellular activities and their func- tions are standardized by Gene Ontology (GO). The amount of discovered pro- tein sequences grows rapidly as a consequence of the fast rate of development of technologies in gene sequencing. In UniProKB, there are more than 200 million proteins. Still, less than 1% of the proteins in the UniProtKB database are exper- imentally GO-annotated, which is the result of the exorbitant cost of biological experiments. To minimize the large gap, developing an efficient and effective method for automatic protein function prediction (AFP) is important.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">Emotion plays a significant role in the way humans understand the true meaning of human-spoken languages. The emotion implicitly expressed by a speaker can change the entire underlying meaning of a sentence. Thus, many studies have investigated methods to identify the speakerâ€™s emotions of spoken languages automatically. This task is very challenging, even for humans, and requires some expertise due to the subtle differences between some emotions (e.g., surprise and anger). Automatic Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is an application of Artificial Intelligence, where Machine Learning models are used to predict the emotion expressed by speakers (Kerkeni et al., 2019). In this work, we use a hierarchical classification approach to see if it can improve the performance of the classical 1-level classifiers in predicting emotions expressed in speech.</div>
